          <h1>What is Sugar Daddy?</h1>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Very successful entrepreneurs, corporate employees and businessmen and women who already know what they want. They are well off individuals who donâ€™t have the time to spend looking for companionship. They have lots of excess money and are ready for the opportunity to connect and support their  Sugar Baby</h2>
          <p class="subtitle"> <h2 class="subtitle">Balancing Schedule</h2>
Elite Consorts will allow you to find relationships according to your schedule. A Sugar Dady is a person who is experienced and responsible, balancing the workplace, home, and passion for his hobbies.  They can be well traveled or ready to travel with that special someone. </p>

<p> <h2 class="subtitle">Makes Time for Pleasure</h2>
An Elite Consort Sugar Daddy is as meticulous about his or her date, just as they would be with their work schedule.  Prioritizing the date on his schedule and then planning out the night, from the time of pick up and arrival to the restaurant to any other activities or travels planned for the occasion. </p>

<p><h2 class="subtitle">Modern Gentleman</h2>
The modern gentleman is the backbone of Elite Consorts.  He has a hectic work schedule and is very successful, but still makes time for the finer things in life. He is knowledgeable and articulate and looking for another attractive person to enhance their journey through life.  Time is money and Elite Consorts is driven to make that time as efficient as possible.</p>

<p><h2 class="subtitle">Work Hard and Plays Harder</h2>
An Elite Consorts Sugar Daddy is all work 24/7. The workplace never ceases to leave his thoughts and just being able to leave the office is a great feat in itself.  A Sugar Daddy may not be able to respond to messages or calls right away, but be patient because he is handling business, so that afterward he can handle a relationship with the same respect and intensity.
